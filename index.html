      <h3>Personal Information</h3>
      <p>Saint Benedict of Nursia (c. 480 – c. 547) was a Christian monk and the founder of the Benedictine order. 
        He was born in Nursia, Italy, to a noble family and received a strong education in Rome. However, feeling 
        disillusioned with the city life, he withdrew to a cave in Subiaco to live as a hermit. During his time there, 
        his holiness and wisdom drew many followers, and he began establishing monasteries.</p>
